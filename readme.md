# Autonomous Robot Navigation System - Level 1

This project implements an autonomous robot navigation system that can navigate to goals in different corners of a simulated environment while avoiding obstacles using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Level 1**: Autonomous navigation to four corners (NE, NW, SE, SW) with obstacle avoidance
- **Computer Vision**: Uses image capture and analysis for obstacle detection
- **Collision Minimization**: Intelligent path planning to minimize collisions
- **Fully Autonomous**: No manual input required after launch
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks collision counts and navigation progress
- **Smart Recovery**: Intelligent collision recovery using computer vision

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sim-1
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the System

### Step 1: Start the Simulator

1. **Start the Python server:**
```bash
python server.py
```
This will start:
- WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8080`
- Flask API on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Open the simulator in your browser:**
- Open `index.html` in your web browser
- Or serve it using: `python -m http.server 8000`
- The simulator will automatically connect to the WebSocket server

### Step 2: Run the Autonomous Robot

**Run Level 1 demo:**
```bash
python smart_robot.py
```

This will:
- Run 4 navigation attempts (one to each corner)
- Use computer vision for obstacle detection
- Track collision counts for each run
- Calculate average collisions per successful run

## How It Works

### Computer Vision Approach

The system uses a simulated computer vision approach where:

1. **Image Capture**: Continuously captures images from the robot's perspective using `/capture` endpoint
2. **Obstacle Detection**: Analyzes images to detect obstacles in the path
3. **Path Planning**: Calculates safe directions avoiding detected obstacles
4. **Navigation**: Moves the robot towards the goal while avoiding collisions
5. **Collision Recovery**: Uses computer vision to find safe directions after collisions

### Navigation Strategy

1. **Goal Setting**: Sets goals in the four corners of the environment
2. **Path Calculation**: Determines the optimal path to the goal
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Detects obstacles and calculates avoidance maneuvers
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitors progress and adjusts path as needed
5. **Smart Recovery**: Intelligent collision recovery without getting stuck in loops

### Level 1 Requirements

- ‚úÖ Navigate to all four corners autonomously
- ‚úÖ Use computer vision for obstacle detection (no hardcoded obstacle positions)
- ‚úÖ Minimize collisions during navigation
- ‚úÖ Fully autonomous operation
- ‚úÖ Track collision statistics
- ‚úÖ Intelligent collision recovery

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /goal` - Set navigation goals
- `POST /move_rel` - Move robot relative to current position
- `POST /capture` - Capture images for computer vision
- `GET /collisions` - Get collision count
- `POST /reset` - Reset simulation

## Files

- `smart_robot.py` - Main autonomous robot navigation system with computer vision
- `server.py` - Main simulator server with WebSocket and Flask API
- `index.html` - 3D simulator interface using Three.js
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `readme.md` - This documentation file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" errors:**
   - Make sure `python server.py` is running
   - Check that ports 5000 and 8080 are available

2. **Simulator not loading:**
   - Ensure `index.html` is opened in a modern browser
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Robot not moving:**
   - Verify WebSocket connection in browser console
   - Check that the simulator is connected

4. **Import errors:**
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.7+

### Performance Tips

- Close unnecessary browser tabs to reduce memory usage
- Use a modern browser for best 3D performance
- Ensure stable internet connection for Three.js CDN resources

## Level 1 Demo

The Level 1 demo will:

1. **Run 4 navigation attempts** - one to each corner
2. **Track collision counts** for each run
3. **Calculate average collisions** per successful run
4. **Provide detailed statistics** of the navigation performance
